# generiC
## Overall Goal
Implement a library of generic classes in C.
## Key Requirements
### Preserve Simplicity
- Try to avoid overly long and/or unintuitive function names that are common among other libraries. Picking up and using this library should be quick and easy. 
### Performance
- Optimize for speed.
### Documentation
- Document all functions and provide examples in code. 
## Done
## In Progress
- list.c: A dynamic generic list
